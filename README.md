# UnityUIHelpers

This is set of assets that can help you setup Unity UI objects. UIPositionHelper allows you to get absolute position of UI object and set the absolute position of UI object regardless of the anchor position or pivot settings. Using this, it becomes much easier to programmatically position UI objects in Unity. One example usage of that is AutoLayout of contents dynamically with different sized contents. 


Below you can see a demo of AutoLayoutContents.
